## Week1
**“What did I learn this week that actually changed how I view professional discipline?”**
I learned that discipline isn’t about willpower — it’s about structure and repetition. Time spent on anything regularly no matter how small, helps a person improve in that field. The repo helped me identifying my habits- every gramatical mistake tells that there is always a space for improvement and no matter how tired you are if you are disciplined you can achieve your goals.
