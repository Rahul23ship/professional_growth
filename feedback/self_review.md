# week 1 - Self Review

## What Went Well
- Maintained daily consistency for 5 days.
- Improved structure and documentation tone.
- Followed professional commit message conventions (e.g. 'chore:','docs:')
- Developed  a clearer understanding of workflow discipline.

## What Can Be Improved
- Add more depth in reflections.
- Reduce typos and message consistency.
- Commit messages are cleaner but could better expain *why* changes were made, not just *what* changed.

## Action Plan
- Proof-read before every commit.
- Begin planning structure for Week 2 (Documentation and Clarity).
