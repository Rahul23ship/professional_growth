# Week 1 Retrospective

## 1. Summary
- Completed all 7 day logs with consistent structure.
- Established a professional workflow (GitHub Desktop, Markdown, clean commits).
- Gained awareness of documentation tone and reflection depth.

## 2. Wins
- Created and maintained functional repo ('professional_growth').
- Improved commits message habits (used prefixes like 'docs:' and 'chore').
- Wrote clear README and workflow overview.
- Started building daily accountability discipline

## 3. Frustrations
- Reflections were rushed on a few days.
- Some commits were not meaningful.

# 4. Lessons Learned
- Structure beats motivation - system works even on tired days.
- Writing clearly requires slowing down.
- Daily discipline compounds - even small logs add identity-level change.

## 5. System Upgrade Plan (Week 2)
- **Focus:** Clarity and Documentation Depth.
- Add a short *"Why this matters"* note at the end  of each log.
