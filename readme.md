#My Personal Growth Journey
This repository tracks my progress to become a professional
I'll log my progress, reflections and completed weekly goals here.

Purpose: This repository will be tracking my progress and will be including tasks that I have to do in this journey. I want to leave my bad habits about doing things the easy way.

Weekly Tracker Structure: This journey will be containing challenges for me divided into weeks. There are 12 weeks that will contain differents tasks that I have to complete within the week. To track and mark those tasks I have also created various week.md files that you will find in the weeks folder.

Feedback: If you want to give a feedback on this repository or to my work you can drop me a message, it can be an advice,error,criticism. That will help me a lot to grow. Thank You.
