# My Personal Growth Journey

This repository tracks my progress to become a professional. I'll log my progress, reflections and completed weekly goals here.

## Purpose/Vision
This repository will be tracking my progress and will be including tasks that I have to do in this journey. I want to leave my bad habits about doing things the easy way and to improve my skills along with it.
"I am undertaking this journey to overcome imposter syndrome and build confidence in professional work.‚Äù

## Weekly Tracker Structure
This journey will be containing challenges for me divided into weeks. There are 12 weeks that will contain differents tasks that I have to complete within the week. To track and mark those tasks I have also created various week.md files that will be in the folder named 'weeks'.
The Weeks are organised in a proper way:
    |WEEK  | FOCUS  |
    |------|--------|
    |Week1 | Discipline Setup |
    |Week2 | Documentation & Clarity |
    |Week3 | Communication Training |
    |Week4 | Time Management & Accountability |
    |Week5 | Real-World Problem Analysis |
    |Week6 | Collaboration Simulation |
    |Week7 | Feedback & Revision |
    |Week8 | Presentation Skill |
    |Week9 | Code Standardization |
    |Week10| Version 2.0 |
    |Week11| Mock Client Project |
    |Week12| Final Reflection |

*More information of these Weeks will be provided in the 'weekX.md' files under the 'weeks/' folder.*
