#My Personal Growth Journey

This repository tracks my progress to become a professional. I'll log my progress, reflections and completed weekly goals here.

Purpose/Vision: This repository will be tracking my progress and will be including tasks that I have to do in this journey. I want to leave my bad habits about doing things the easy way and to improve my skills along with it.
Fear: I am doing this to remove my fear of being exposed i.e., imposter syndrome.

Weekly Tracker Structure: This journey will be containing challenges for me divided into weeks. There are 12 weeks that will contain differents tasks that I have to complete within the week. To track and mark those tasks I have also created various week.md files that will be in the folder named 'weeks'.

Plan: The Weeks are organised in a proper way:
    Week1-Discipline Setup
    Week2-Documentation & Clarity
    Week3-Communication Training
    Week4-Time Management & Accountability
    Week5-Real-World Problem Analysis
    Week6-Collaboration Simulation
    Week7-Feedback & Revision
    Week8-Presentation Skill
    Week9-Code Standardization
    Week10-Version 2.0
    Week11-Mock Client Project
    Week12-Final Reflection
More information of these Weeks will be provided in the week files under the weeks folder.
